 Environment Variables and Azure Key Vault Usage

## 1. Local Development
- `appsettings.Development.json` contains secrets for local use only.
- You can also set environment variables manually in your terminal or IDE.
- Example:
  ```
  set CosmosDb__ConnectionString=AccountEndpoint=...;AccountKey=...
  ```

## 2. Docker/Containerized Environments
- Secrets and config values are injected as environment variables using `docker-compose` or Dockerfile `ENV` instructions.
- Example in `docker-compose.yml`:
  ```yaml
  environment:
    - CosmosDb__ConnectionString=${COSMOSDB_CONNECTION_STRING}
  ```

## 3. Azure App Service (Production/Cloud)
- **Secrets are never stored in code or config files.**
- In Azure, set environment variables in the App Service Configuration blade.
- For production secrets, use Azure Key Vault references:
  - In App Service, set an app setting like:
    ```
    @Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://<your-keyvault-name>.vault.azure.net/secrets/<secret-name>/<secret-version>)
    ```
  - The app setting key matches what your app expects (e.g., `CosmosDb__ConnectionString`).
  - Azure injects the secret value from Key Vault as an environment variable at runtime.

## 4. How the App Reads These Values
- The app uses .NET configuration providers, which automatically read from:
  - appsettings.json
  - Environment variables
  - Azure Key Vault (via environment variable reference)
- In code (see Program.cs), you access config like:
  ```csharp
  var cosmosConnectionString = builder.Configuration["CosmosDb:ConnectionString"];
  ```
- In production, this value comes from the environment variable, which is populated from Key Vault.

## 5. Security Benefits
- No secrets in code or source control.
- Key Vault provides secure, auditable storage for secrets.
- Managed Identity allows the app to access Key Vault without credentials.
