# API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

## Overview
All microservices in this solution expose RESTful APIs documented using Swagger (OpenAPI). This enables easy discovery, testing, and integration for developers and consumers.

---

## 1. Swagger Integration
- Each .NET service (inventory, order, product) uses the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore package to generate Swagger/OpenAPI docs at runtime.
- Swagger UI is enabled in development and test environments for interactive API exploration.
- The OpenAPI spec (JSON) is available at `/swagger/v1/swagger.json` for each service.

## 2. How to Access
- Run any service locally (e.g., `dotnet run` or via Docker Compose).
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/swagger` to view the Swagger UI.
- The UI lists all endpoints, request/response schemas, and allows you to try out API calls.

## 3. OpenAPI Specification
- The OpenAPI spec is auto-generated from controllers, routes, and data annotations.
- It includes:
  - Endpoint paths and HTTP methods
  - Request and response models (DTOs)
  - Query parameters, path parameters, and request bodies
  - Response codes and descriptions
  - Security schemes (if enabled)

## 4. Customization
- XML comments in code are included for richer documentation.
- You can customize the Swagger UI and OpenAPI metadata in `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`.
- Security definitions (e.g., JWT Bearer) can be added for protected endpoints.

## 5. CI/CD and Deployment
- Swagger/OpenAPI docs are available in all deployed environments (unless disabled for production).
- The OpenAPI spec can be used to generate client SDKs or for API management onboarding.

---

**Summary:**
- Every service exposes interactive API docs via Swagger UI and OpenAPI spec.
- Docs are always up-to-date with the codebase.
- This enables rapid onboarding, testing, and integration for developers and consumers.
